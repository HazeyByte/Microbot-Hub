/**
 * Per-login behavioural identity for the MLM bot.
 *
 * <h3>Why this exists</h3>
 * Believable behaviour is <em>consistent</em>, not merely random. A behavioural classifier keys on
 * two things: how stable a player is <em>within</em> a session, and how much players differ
 * <em>between</em> sessions. Re-rolling every decision from a global RNG (e.g. "70% park the mouse
 * off-screen" independently each bout) produces the opposite — a run with no identity and two logins
 * that are statistically identical.
 *
 * <p>This class is rolled <b>once</b> per {@code run()} (login) from a per-session seed, producing a
 * fixed trait vector. Every probability/timing knob below is a pure function of those traits, so the
 * numbers stay constant for the whole session and differ from login to login. Call sites read the
 * named accessors instead of hard-coding literals, which also makes this the single home for
 * behavioural tuning (the constants that used to be scattered across the script and sessions).
 *
 * <p>The randomness the bot exhibits still comes from {@link Rs2Random} at the moment of action — but
 * it is now <em>gated by a stable character</em> rather than floating free. An impatient, mouse-confident
 * player stays that way all session; a relaxed AFK-heavy player keeps parking the cursor off-screen.
